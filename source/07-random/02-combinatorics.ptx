            <p>
While counting seems like a very basic mathematical task, <term>combinatorics</term> is the
mathematics of counting quantities that are difficult to manage by hand (or even by computer).

        <task>
            <p>
Explain how you'd help a five-year-old count how many numbers in the set <m>\{3,4,5,\dots,24,25\}</m> end with
a <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, or <m>9</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
How many of the counting numbers in the set <m>\{3,4,5,\dots,2024,2025\}</m> end with
a <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, or <m>9</m>? You probably don't want deal with over two thousand
numbers by hand, so first fix the list comprehension
<c>[x for x in range(21,50) if x%10 in [3,8,9]]</c> to produce a list of all such numbers.
Then use the <c>len()</c> tool to count them.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Without using technology, how many numbers in the set <m>\{1,2,\dots,10\}</m> end with
a <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, or <m>9</m>? How can you use that result to find how many numbers
in the set <m>\{1,2,\dots,100\}</m> end with those digits? What about the set
<m>\{1,2,\dots,1000\}</m>?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Use the ideas from the previous task to count the numbers in the set <m>\{11,12,\dots,1008\}</m>
that end with a <m>2</m>, <m>7</m>, or <m>9</m>. Then confirm your result using technology.
