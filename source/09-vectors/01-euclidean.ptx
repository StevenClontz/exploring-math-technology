        <introduction>
            <p>
A <term>Euclidean vector</term> is an ordered list of real numbers. (We'll just call them
vectors, although there are other kinds of vectors as well.) They are usually written in a
vertical column or as an ordered tuple:
            </p>
            <me>
\left(\begin{array}{r}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{array}\right)=
\left(1,\,2,\,3\right)
            </me>
            <p>
The <term>dimension</term> of a vector counts how many numbers it lists. Note that two-dimensional
vectors store the same information as complex numbers:
            </p>
            <me>
\left(\begin{array}{r}
4 \\
-3
\end{array}\right)=
\left(4,-3\right)=
4-3i
            </me>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Addition is defined in the same way for complex numbers and two-dimensional vectors.
Find <m>(5-12i)+(-3-4i)</m> and <m>(5,-12)+(-3,-4)</m> without using technnology.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Write a sentence explaining the rule for adding two-dimensional vectors
<m>(a,b)+(c,d)</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Assuming this pattern continues, what should be the value of
<m>(1,2,3,4,5)+(10,20,30,40,50)</m>?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Trying to add vectors in SageMath with <c>(5,-12)+(-3,4)</c> gives the
incorrect result of <c>(5,-12,-3,4)</c>. (These are considered tuples, and
the <c>+</c> operator concatenates tuples together.)
Instead, we must convert them to vectors first: <c>vector([5,-12])+vector([-3,4])</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
Use this technique to add <m>(1,2,3,4,5)+(10,20,30,40,50)</m> in SageMath.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Like complex numbers, two-dimensional and three-dimensional vectors are often used
to represent positional data, compared with an origin <term>zero vector</term>
<m>(0,0)</m> or <m>(0,0,0)</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
The position two units up/north and three units left/west from the origin
is given by the complex number <m>-3+2i</m>. What vector represents that
same point?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Give a vector representing four units right/east and one unit down/south
from the origin.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Describe the point reached by moving two units up and three units left,
followed by four units right and one unit down, as the addition of two vectors.
Then compute that sum of vectors.
