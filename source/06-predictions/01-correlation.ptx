Consider the following scatter plots comparing college math placement exam scores to SAT math exam scores
and the size of each student's high school.

Historically, the college placed students who recieved higher placement exam scores into more
advanced math courses.
But suppose this college decided to save money and time by no longer offering a math placement exam.

Should the college place students who come from larger schools into more advanced math courses?
Write a few sentences on why you agree or disagree, based on both the scatter plot and your intuition.

            <p>
When pairs of data values tend to fall along a line, that data is said to be linearly
<term>correlated</term>. The <term>correlation coefficient</term> of these pairs of values is a
number between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> that describes the strength of this correlation, known
briefly as <m>r</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
A value of <m>r=1</m> means that the points of data fall exactly along an upward line, that is,
one value tends to increase as the other value increases. On the other hand, <m>r=-1</m>
means that the points of data fall exactly along a downward line, that is,
one value tends to increase as the otehr value decreases.
A value of <m>r=0</m> means there's no recognizable linear relationship between the pairs of data values.
            </p>
            <p>
However, most real datasets will have a fractional <m>r</m> value. Nonetheless, the closer this value is to
<m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>, the stronger the correlation, while the closer this value is to <m>0</m>,
the weaker the correlation. This is illustrated in <xref ref="predictions-correlation-coefficients"/>
(obtained from <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</url>).

            <p>
The mathematics used to compute <m>r</m> are outside the scope of this course, so we will focus on
understanding what <m>r</m> communicates about a dataset and how to compute <m>r</m> using technology.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Unfortunately, the <c>datascience</c> library doesn't provide a great out-of-the-box mechanism for computing
<m>r</m>. Fortunately, we can add two features to our <c>datascience</c> tables by copy-pasting
the snippet given in <xref ref="predictions-correlation-features"/> into a Code cell. (This will need to be
done in every notebook that uses these features.)
            </p>

            </listing>
            <p>
While we won't go into detail on how correlation is measured, it is related to the measures of center and spread studied
in the previous chapter. Inspect the code shown in <xref ref="predictions-correlation-features"/>; what measure
of center and what measure of spread appear to be used to compute correlation?

When <xref ref="predictions-correlation-features"/> is run successfully, no output will be shown. However, you should now be
able to create a table by running <c>ctable = Table().with_correlated_columns()</c>. (Note that this table is generated
somewhat randomly, so re-running that line will create a slightly different table.)

Based on the definition of the correlation coefficient <m>r</m> and the illustration given in

of data to be closer to <m>-1</m>, <m>0</m>, or <m>1</m>?
