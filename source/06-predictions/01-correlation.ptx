Consider the following scatter plots comparing college math placement exam scores to SAT math exam scores
and the size of each student's high school.

Historically, the college placed students who recieved higher placement exam scores into more
advanced math courses.
But suppose this college decided to save money and time by no longer offering a math placement exam.

Should the college place students who come from larger schools into more advanced math courses?
Write a few sentences on why you agree or disagree, based on both the scatter plot and your intuition.
