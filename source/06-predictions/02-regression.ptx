Consider the following scatter plot of math placement exam scores to SAT math exam scores.
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="predictions-regression-preview-scattered">
                <caption>Scatter plot comparing SAT and math placement scores</caption>

        <task>
            <p>
What were the maximum and minimum placement scores earned by students who scored 60
on the SAT math exam?

            <p>
Suppose a student was unable to take the placement exam, but scored 60 on the SAT math exam?
What would be a <q>fair</q> placement exam score to assign to that student based upon this data?

        <introduction>
            <p>
When a scatter plot indicates a linear relationship,
a <term>regression line</term> or <term>fit line</term> is often added to the plot to illustrate
this linear behavior.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Add the <c>with_correlated_columns</c> and <c>correlation</c> features from the previous section
to this notebook.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Create three tables with correlated columns: <c>clean_table</c>, <c>noisy_table</c>, and <c>noisiest_table</c>.
Let all tables have a slope of <m>3</m>, but set the noise values as <m>1,10,30</m> respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
Display their scatter plots below, and compute the correlation for each table.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Display their scatter plots again, but this time use <c>.scatter("x",fit_line=True)</c> to
display the fit line for each plot.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Write some observations about the slopes of each fit line (the vertical rise divided by horizontal
run), the how the data is spread out from each fit line, the correlation coefficients you found,
and how you generated these datasets. (Be sure to look at the vertical axis of each plot, since
each plot scales this axis differently.)
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Describe the general rule that describes the relationship between the correlation coefficient <m>r</m> and when a fit line
appears to accurately describe the behavior of data.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Generate a scatter plot for correlated columns with a noise of <m>2</m> and a slope of <m>-5</m>.
Show its fit line, and compute its correlation coefficient.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Does this demonstrate how the rule you made above should be fixed? If so, fix it to account for this
new example.

When appropriate, a fit line based on sample data can be used to predict the value of unsampled data.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Get a copy of <c>testing_table</c> from 4.3 available for use in this notebook, and use code cells
to produce the scatter plot shown in
<xref ref="predictions-regression-preview-scattered"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
Don't forget to use <c>import matplotlib</c>, <c>%matplotlib inline</c>, and
<c>.where("column_name",are.above(0))</c> appropriately.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Add a fit line to this plot.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
This table has historical data for a full range of SAT scores. But what if historical data only existed
for SAT math scores of 60 or greater? Emulate this by showing a scatter plot with a fit line that only considers
records with an SAT math score that <c>are.above(60)</c>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
If you were to extend this fit line left to where an SAT math score of <m>40</m> would go, about what score
for the math placement score would the fit line predict?
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
How does this compare to the actual data?

a computer). Based on your work in these exercises, which set of data could you more
confidently make predictions from? Why?
