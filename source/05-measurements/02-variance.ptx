            <p>
Consider the data in the lists
<c>[13, 12, 11, 10, 10, 14, 13, 10, 10, 14, 15, 11, 11, 13, 15, 15, 13, 15, 14, 11]</c>
and
<c>[19, 12, 13, 9, 15, 5, 6, 12, 9, 14, 8, 20, 19, 15, 13, 9, 14, 14, 7, 17]</c>.

        <task>
            <p>

        <task>
            <p>
Draw a dot plot visualizing the data in each list.

        <task>
            <p>
What does the dot plot tell you about the data that the measures of center do not?
