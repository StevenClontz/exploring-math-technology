Consider the data in the lists
<c>[13, 12, 11, 10, 10, 14, 13, 10, 10, 14, 15, 11, 11, 13, 15, 15, 13, 15, 14, 11]</c>

Show that the mean, median, and mode for the data in the first list are the same as the second list.

Draw a dot plot or histogram visualizing the data in each list.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Often we are interested in the <term>spread</term> of values in a dataset. The simplest
measure of spread is the <term>range</term> of data: the difference between its
largest value (its <term>maximum</term>) and its smallest value (its <term>minimum</term>).
For example, the range of the values in
<m>3,3,6,7,12,12,16,19</m> is <m>\text{max}-\text{min}=19-3=16</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Find the maximum, minimum, and range for the values
<m>9, 2, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Find the maximum, minimum, and range for the values
<m>5, 1, 3, 998, 2, 5, 8, 2</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
What do you notice about the previous task? How does the range
relate (or not relate) to the majority of the data?

Get a copy of <c>pizza_table</c> available for this notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
Set <c>classic_prices = pizza_table.where("type","classic").column("price")</c>,
and then use <c>min(classic_prices)</c> and <c>max(classic_prices)</c> to describe
the mininum price, maximum price, and range of prices for classic pizzas sold by
the pizzeria.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Display a box plot and histogram for the table of classic pizza prices
<c>pizza_table.where("type","classic").select("price")</c>.

        <task>
            <p>
Notice that the box plot displays <term>outliers</term> in the data as dots:
the values that are further away from the median than most points of data.
            </p>
            <p>
Ignoring outliers, what is an approximate range of the classic pizza prices?

The <term>absolute mean deviation</term> measures pretty much exactly what it says:
how far the data deviate from the dataset's mean.

While the absolute mean deviation provides an easy-to-implement measurement
of data spread, an alternative formula is used to compute <term>standard deviation</term>.

The other formula shown above measures standard deviation. While the formulas have similarities,
the standard deviation formula has certain nice mathematical properties that make it more commonly used by
data scientists. (We defer exploring what those advantages are exactly to more advanced statistics courses.)
            </p>
            <p>
We wrote our own program to compute absolute mean deviations, but
the standard deviation of a list may be computed in Python simply by using
<c>from statistics import stdev</c>. Show that the standard deviations of the datasets studied
in the previous activity are not exactly the same as the absolute mean deviations, but they
still do the same job of communicating how one dataset is spread out more than the other.

        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Write a few sentences explaining your intuition for why the standard deviation
for the prices of classic pizzas was larger/smaller than the standard deviation
for the prices of large pizzas.

There is no hard-and-fast mathematical definition for what makes a value an outlier:
different areas of study may allow for more or less tolerance for <q>unusual</q> values. However,
one common assumption (known as the <term>three-sigma rule</term>) is that
non-outlier data should be within three standard deviations of the mean, that is,
each distance of a piece of non-outlier data from the mean should be less than
<m>3\times\text{stdev}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Explain why the three-sigma rule requires that the range of non-outlier data
should be less than six standard deviations, or <m>6\times\text{stdev}</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
For example, if a dataset has a standard deviation of <m>4</m>, it's reasonable to expect
that the range of non-outlier data is less than <m>24</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Confirm that the <c>datascience</c> library generates a box plot of large pizza prices
that shows no outliers. Then confirm that the range of large pizza prices is less than
six times its standard deviation.

        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Use a box plot of classic pizza prices to show that the range of its non-outlier data is
less than six standard deviations.
