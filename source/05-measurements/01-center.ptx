        <introduction>
            <p>
There are several notions of <q>average</q>, that is, several ways to describe the
center of a dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
Often, <q>average</q> is used to describe the <term>mean</term> of a dataset.
If a dataset contains the <m>n</m> values <m>x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}</m>, then the
mean is defined by the following formula:
            </p>
            <me>
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{0\leq k&lt; n} x_k = \frac{x_0+x_1+\dots+x_{n-1}}{n}
            </me>
            <p>
For example, the mean of the counting numbers <m>2,3,5,7,18</m> is <m>\frac{2+3+5+7+18}{5}=7</m>:
all the values in the collection are added together, and then divided by the amount of data
in the collection.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Show that <m>8</m> is the mean of the counting numbers <m>4,8,9,11</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Is it possible for the mean of a dataset to not belong to the dataset itself?
If so, give an example of such a dataset. If not, explain why.

First, make a copy of the <c>pizza_table</c> used in previous sections available for this notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
Then, correct the code in <xref ref="measurements-center-pizza-mean"/> to output the
correct mean of the costs of pizza sold on Nov 10.

        <introduction>
            <p>
The <term>mode</term> of a dataset is simply its most-repeated value.
For example, the mode of the collection of values <m>4,5,5,5,8,9,9,10</m> is <m>5</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Find the mode of the values <m>8, 6, 1, 3, 3, 1, 9, 9, 1, 4</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
It's possible that a dataset may have many different modes. For example,
both <m>2</m> and <m>5</m> are modes for the values in the list
<c>[3,2,6,5,5,11,2,7]</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
Make up an example of a dataset with
seven values that has both <m>3</m> and <m>8</m> as modes.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
The Python library <c>statistics</c> provides convenient tools for computing statistical
measures. For example, <c>from statistics import mean</c> and
<c>mean(prices)</c> is a shortcut to compute the mean of a list of values in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
Replace <c>mean</c> with <c>mode</c> to write a program that outputs
the mode of the list <c>[3,2,6,5,5,11,2,7]</c>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
While earlier we noted that there are two different modes for the list
<c>[3,2,6,5,5,10,2,7]</c>, the <c>mode</c> tool only returns the mode that appears first
in the list.
            </p>
            <p>
Show how to use <c>multimode</c> in place of <c>mode</c> to return a list of all modes
for <c>[3,2,6,5,5,11,2,7]</c>.
            </p>

        <introduction>
            <p>
When data is ordered from least to greatest, the middle value is called its <term>median</term>.
For example, the median of <m>1,1,6,7,9</m> is <m>6</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Find the median of <m>9,12,3,0,11,9,2</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
If a dataset has two middle values, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then their mean <m>\frac{a+b}{2}</m>
is used as the median. For example, the median of <m>4,6,7,9,10,13</m> is <m>\frac{7+9}{2}=8</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Make up a collection of six numbers such that its median is <m>5.5</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>

Create a histogram and box plot for the prices of pizzas sold on Oct 09.
Do these visualizations effectively communicate the mean, mode, or median computed earlier?
What might the visualizations communicate that isn't described by the mean, mode, or median?
Write a few sentences summarizing your thoughts.
