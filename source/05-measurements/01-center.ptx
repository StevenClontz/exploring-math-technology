A group of seven friends decides to compare their tax returns,
listed in <xref ref="measurements-center-returns"/>.

<q>The most common tax return is $2,000. Therefore, the average tax return in this group is $2,000.</q>

<q>When ordered from least to greatest, the middle tax return is $2,500.
Therefore, the average tax return in this group is $2,500.</q>

            <p>
<q>When the seven returns are added together and divided by <m>7</m>, the result is $4,000.

        <introduction>
            <p>
There are several notions of <q>average</q>, that is, several ways to describe the
center of a dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
Often, <q>average</q> is used to describe the <term>mean</term> of a dataset.
If a dataset contains the <m>n</m> values <m>\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}</m>, then the
mean <m>\overline x</m> is defined by the following formula:
            </p>
            <me>
\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{0\leq k&lt; n} x_k = \frac{x_0+x_1+\dots+x_{n-1}}{n}
            </me>
            <p>
For example, the mean of <m>\{2,3,5,7,8\}</m> is <m>\frac{2+3+5+7+8}{5}=5</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Show that <m>7</m> is the mean of the dataset <m>\{3,7,8,10\}</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Is it possible for the mean of a dataset to not belong to the dataset itself?
If so, give an example of such a dataset. If not, explain why.
