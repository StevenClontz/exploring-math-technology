Many of the features of the Python language/kernel are optimized for computational
efficiency, such as using binary approximations of fractions. This is valuable for
applications like data science, but for studying mathematics itself we will
find it useful to have another kernel available to more precisely model things.
            </p>

        <task>
            <p>
Use the latest <c>SageMath</c> kernel to confirm that <c>6^2</c> and
<c>6**2</c> both represent <m>6^2=36</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Confirm that <c>1/10+1/5</c> equals exactly <m>\frac{3}{10}</m> in SageMath.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Finally, use <c>show( (x+1)^3 == ((x+1)^3).full_simplify() )</c> to confirm the
algebraic formula <m>(x+1)^3=x^3+3x^2+3x+1</m>.

        <introduction>
            <p>
SageMath is a mathematical software system designed for representing ideas
from mathematics as faithfully as possible.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Several important numbers in mathematics may be used in SageMath with <c>pi</c>
for the circular constant <m>\pi</m>, <c>e</c> for the natural number <m>e</m>,
and <c>i</c> for the imaginary unit <m>i</m>. (Don't worry if you aren't familiar
with these yet.)
            </p>
            <p>
Check to see what Sage gives as the value of <m>e^{i\pi}+1</m>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
SageMath won't approximate any values unless asked. You can check this by typing <c>pi^2</c>
and <c>e^3</c>. To make them appear with mathematical formatting as <m>\pi^2</m>
and <m>e^3</m>, use the <c>show()</c> syntax
like you did in <xref ref="programming-sagemath-preview"/>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
If an approximation is desired, the numerical approximation tool <c>n</c> may be used.
Find an approximate value for <m>\sqrt{2}</m> by using <c>sqrt(2).n(digits=10)</c>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Which is bigger: <m>\pi^e</m> or <m>e^\pi</m>?

        <introduction>
            <p>
The term <term>variable</term> means slightly differen things in computer science and mathematics.
In computer science, variables are used to store and retrieve
data within an application. In mathematics, variables are used to represent an
arbitrary or unknown value of data within a statement.
            </p>
            <p>
These two concepts are related, but not exactly the same. Since SageMath is built upon Python,
it provides support for both <term>CS variables</term> and <term>math variables</term>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
To assign a value to a CS variable, the <term>assignment operator</term> <c>=</c> is used.
It's considered best practice to give CS variables long descriptive names such as
<c>temperature_in_room</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
For each member of your group, use a code cell to assign a CS variable storing the day of the
month each person was born.
An example is given in <xref ref="programming-sagemath-bdays"/>;
note that only a single Code cell is necessary, but each assignment should be made on a separate line.
