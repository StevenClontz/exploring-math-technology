Many of the features of the Python language/kernel are optimized for computational
efficiency, such as using binary approximations of fractions. This is valuable for
applications like data science, but for studying mathematics itself we will
find it useful to have another kernel available to more precisely model things.

Use the latest <c>SageMath</c> kernel to confirm that <c>6^2</c> and
<c>6**2</c> are both equal to <m>36</m>.

Confirm that <c>1/10+1/5</c> equals exactly <m>\frac{3}{10}</m> in SageMath.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Finally, use <c>show( (x+1)^3 == ((x+1)^3).full_simplify() )</c> to confirm the
algebraic formula <m>(x+1)^3=x^3+3x^2+3x+1</m>.

SageMath is a mathematical software system designed for representing ideas
from mathematics as faithfully as possible.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Several important numbers in mathematics may be used in SageMath with <c>pi</c>
for the circular constant <m>\pi</m>, <c>e</c> for the natural number <m>e</m>,
and <c>i</c> for the imaginary unit <m>i</m>. (Don't worry if you aren't familiar
with these yet.)
            </p>
            <p>
Check to see what Sage gives as the value of <m>e^{i\pi}+1</m>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
SageMath won't approximate any values unless asked. You can check this by typing <c>pi^2</c>
and <c>e^3</c>. To make them appear with mathematical formatting as <m>\pi^2</m>
and <m>e^3</m>, use the <c>show()</c> syntax
like you did in <xref ref="programming-sagemath-preview"/>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
If an approximation is desired, the numerical approximation tool <c>n</c> may be used.
Find an approximate value for <m>\sqrt{2}</m> by using <c>sqrt(2).n(digits=10)</c>.
            </p>
         </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Which is bigger: <m>\pi^e</m> or <m>e^\pi</m>?
