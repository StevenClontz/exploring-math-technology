Throughout this course, you will complete the activities from this text within
Jupyter notebooks hosted on <url href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc.com</url>, some
individually, and some within groups.
Your first activity is to set these Jupyter notebooks up for yourself!
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
First, either create an account at <url href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc.com</url>,
or log in with the account provided by your instructor.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
Go to <url href="#">TODO https://share.cocalc.com/share/d17525â€¦</url>,
and use the <q>Open in CoCalc</q> button to create
a new project with your notebooks for the course.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
Open the <c>Settings</c> for this project, and add your instructor's account as a
<c>Collaborator</c>. This allows them to see your work, and unlock the premium features
required for this course (such as importing data from other websites to analyze).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
Finally, navigate to the notebook associated with this activity. (You may need
to select a <q>kernel</q> to open it; that choice is not important for now, so
pick anything.) In the editable textbox
appearing below this activity in the notebook, double-click to edit, erase any default content,
and type the well-worn phrase of computing: <c>Hello World!</c>. Tap
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to save your note.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <introduction>
            <p>
Jupyter notebooks consist of <term>cells</term> that can include either writing or
code. Let's explore how writing code in Jupyter works.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
To write and execute code, your notebook needs to have a <term>kernel</term>,
that is, an associated programming language. Select a <code>Python 3</code> kernel from
the notebook menu. (If there are multiple versions of Python 3 available,
it doesn't matter which one you choose. Do not choose a Python 2 kernel, however.)
            </p>
            <p>
Once you've done this, edit the contents of the below cell to read
<c>import sys; sys.version</c> and hit <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Most likely, the result of entering the code
<c>import sys; sys.version</c> into the above cell just make the text
<q>import sys; sys.version</q> appear. This is because the editable
cells in this notebook are set to <q>Markdown</q> mode by default, which is used
for writing text, such as the paragraph you're currently reading.
(If the above cell wasn't already in Markdown mode, use the menu
to switch it to Markdown mode, so the output is simply
<q>import sys; sys.version</q>.)
            </p>
            <p>
Now enter <c>import sys; sys.version</c> into the below cell, and use the menu to switch
the cell type to <q>Code</q>. Now using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> should
display something like <c>'3.6.9 (default, Apr 18 2020, 01:56:04) \n[GCC 8.4.0]'</c>,
the version of the Python kernel you selected.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Each task in these notebooks includes a single editable Markdown cell by default.
However, you may add as many Markdown and Code cells as you like by clicking above or below
an existing cell.
            </p>
            <p>
Enter <c>The value of 1+1 is:</c> into the below Markdown cell. Then
create a Code cell below it with the contents <c>1+1</c> to calculate the result.
            </p>
        </task>
    </activity>

        <introduction>
            <p>
Jupyter notebooks provide a convenient interface for communiating mathematics
and data science. The Jupyter server CoCalc.com also provides access to a full Linux
environment, which you can access from your browser without installing anything on
your computer.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
To access the Linux command-line interface, go to <q>Files</q> and create a new
<q>Terminal</q> file.
            </p>
            <p>
We can use the Linux command-line program <c>cat</c> to display information about
the version of Linux being run, which is stored in the file <c>/etc/os-release</c>.
To do this, enter <c>cat /etc/os-release</c> in your terminal. Copy and paste the
results (which should include a line such as
<c>PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS"</c>) into the below cell. (It's okay
if the line breaks pasted from the terminal don't appear in the output below;
we will explore Markdown formatting in a later activity.)
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
You can upload any files you need to CoCalc, which can then be used by your notebooks.
Use a search engine to find an image of a <q>Klein bottle</q> on the internet. Download
a copy of this image to your computer. Using the <q>New</q> menu option in CoCalc,
upload a copy of this image to the server, in the same folder as this notebook's
file.
            </p>
            <p>
Make this image display in the below Markdown cell by entering
<c>![Klein bottle](image.png)</c>, replacing <c>image.png</c>
with the filename of the image you uploaded. (The text <c>Klein bottle</c> is used
to describe the image in case it doesn't load, or for those using a screen reader.)
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Now create a new file called <c>data.csv</c> in the same folder as this notebook.
Copy-paste the text from <xref ref="programming-jupyter-tempdata"/> into this
new file to save a <term>Comma-Separated Values spreadsheet</term>.
            </p>
            <listing xml:id="programming-jupyter-tempdata">
                <p><cd>Time,TempInF
8:00,74
9:00,78
10:00,82
11:00,85
12:00,88
13:00,89
14:00,90

16:00,89
17:00,88</cd></p>
            </listing>
            <p>
Then copy-paste the text from <xref ref="programming-jupyter-use-tempdata"/> into
a Code cell below to use this data in a Python 3 script to display the temperatures
in Celcius.
            </p>
            <listing xml:id="programming-jupyter-use-tempdata">
                <p><cd>import csv
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    rows = csv.DictReader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
    for row in rows:
        temp = format((float(row["TempInF"])-32)*5/9, '.2f')
        print("The temperature at "+row["Time"]+" is "+temp+" degrees Celcius.")</cd></p>
            </listing>
