Use code cells to find the squares of the counting numbers from <m>0</m> to <m>9</m>:
<m>0^2=0</m>, <m>1^2=1</m>, <m>2^2=4</m>, <m>\cdots</m>. (Remember that <c>**</c> is
used in Python to denote an exponent.)

            <p>
The sum of the cubes of <m>0</m> through <m>4</m> may be found by running
<c>0**3+1**3+2**3+3**3+4**3</c>, which turns out to be <m>100</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Show that the sum of the squares of <m>0</m> through <m>9</m> is equal to <m>285</m>.

To avoid a lot of repetition, we may quickly produce the cubes of <m>0</m> through <m>4</m>
as a <term>list</term> by running <c>cubes = [n**3 for n in range(5)]</c>.
Then <c>sum(cubes)</c> also results in <m>100</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Adapt this technique to show that the sum of the squares of <m>0</m> through <m>99</m>
is equal to <m>328{,}350</m>.

            <p>
An unordered collection of mathematical objects is known as a <term>set</term>.
Sets are written as a pair of curly braces surrounding a description of its members,
such as <m>\{2,8,1,4\}</m>.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Sets may be declared in Python and SageMath using the syntax <c>{2,8,1,4}</c>.
Use this syntax and the equality operator <c>==</c> to confirm that
<m>\{100,101,100\}=\{101,100\}=\{100,101\}</m> are all the same set (since
they all contain exactly the same numbers).
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
There are only four sets that only use the numbers <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>:
<m>\{\},\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
List all the sets that only use the numbers <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Based on these examples, guess how many sets only use the counting
numbers <m>0</m> through <m>7</m>. Explain your reasoning.

            <p>
The size of a set is known as its <term>cardinality</term>, which can be
computed by SageMath: <c>{0,1,2}.cardinality()</c>. SageMath is also able
to measure infinite cardinalities: <c>QQ.cardinality()</c> confirms that there
are infinitely-many rational numbers (represented in SageMath by <c>QQ</c>).
            </p>
            <p>
Use SageMath to confirm that <m>\{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19\}</m> contains 
            </p>

            <p>
Sets are useful collections when you only care if a datum belongs to the set
or not. But sometimes you want your data to be ordered, and sometimes you
want to be able count the same datum multiple times in your collection.
<!--(There are also other shortcomings, such as not being able to define a set
containing sets itself, such as <m>\{\{0\},\{1,2\}\}</m>.)-->
This is where <term>lists</term> are useful.
