An unordered collection of mathematical objects is known as a <term>set</term>.
Sets are written as a pair of curly braces surrounding a description of its members,
such as <m>\{2,8,1,4\}</m>.

Sets may be declared in Python and SageMath using the syntax <c>{2,8,1,4}</c>.
Use this syntax and the equality operator <c>==</c> to confirm that
<m>\{100,101,100\}=\{101,100\}=\{100,101\}</m> are all the same set (since
they all contain exactly the same numbers).

            <p>
There are only four sets that only use the numbers <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>:
<m>\{\},\{0\},\{1\},\{0,1\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
List all the sets that only use the numbers <m>0</m>, <m>1</m>, and <m>2</m>.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Based on these examples, guess how many sets only use the counting
numbers <m>0</m> through <m>7</m>.
