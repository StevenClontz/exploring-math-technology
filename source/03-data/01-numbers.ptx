            <p>
The <term>counting numbers</term> (sometimes written as the lowercase Greek
letter omega <m>\omega</m>, also sometimes called
<q>whole numbers</q> or <q>natural numbers</q>) are those numbers used to
quantify whole items: <me>\{0,1,2,3,\dots,100,101,\dots,8675309,8675310,\dots\}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
For each of the following possible rules for counting numbers, either decide that
it is true, or explain when the rule might fail.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Adding one to a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>6</m> is a counting number, so <m>6+1=7</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Subtracting one from a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>6</m> is a counting number, so <m>6-1=5</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Doubling a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>32</m> is a counting number, so <m>32\times 2=64</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Halving a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>32</m> is a counting number, so <m>32\div 2=16</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Squaring a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>9</m> is a counting number, so <m>9^2=81</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Square rooting a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>9</m> is a counting number, so <m>\sqrt{9}=3</m> is also a counting number.

The <term>rational numbers</term> <m>\mathbb Q</m> include all fractions of integers
that don't divide by zero, such as <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{22}{7}</m>,

There are other kinds of <term>real numbers</term>, such as <m>e</m> and <m>\pi</m>, that aren't
rational. (The technical definition of the system of real numbers requires experience with
calculus, so we won't get into that here.) There are other kinds of numbers as well,
such as the <term>complex numbers</term> explorered in <xref ref="complex"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
Since SageMath tries to model mathematics as authentically as possible, it will try to recognize
when you are working with integers or rational numbers. For example, <c>type(-17/3)</c>
display that it is a <q><c>sage.rings.rational.Rational</c></q>
            </p>
            <p>
Use the <c>type()</c> tool to help explain why <m>-\frac{1234812348}{42}</m> is an integer or
rational number.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Something all these sets of numbers described above is that they are <term>infinite</term>:
if you had a finite list of them, take the biggest and add one, and you'll have something
you forgot in your list.
            </p>
            <p>
While SageMath does its best to hide this limitation from users,
having finitely-many possible numbers is not ideal for data intended
for storage on a physical computer.
To account for this, some lower-level languages offer data types like the <term>short</term>
that account for a useful (but finite) range of integers.
In particular, shorts are integers that may be stored as a short finite list of the
binary digits <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>. (Each binary digit is also known as a <term>bit</term>.)
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
Only two numbers may be described using one binary digit: <m>0_2</m> and <m>1_2</m>.
Only four numbers may be described using two binary digits: <m>00_2</m>, <m>01_2</m>, <m>10_2</m>, and <m>11_2</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Describe all the possible numbers using three binary digits.

What do you notice about this pattern? According to this pattern, how many numbers
do you expect can be described using four binary digits? Five digits?

A <term>nibble</term> of computer storage uses four bits (binary digits). How many different values of data
can be stored in a nibble?
            </p>

How many bytes equals twelve nibbles?

        <exercise>
            <statement>
            <p>
A <term>float</term> data type is one used to store fractions using binary numbers. A simple float
might use the following two bytes of data...
            </p>
            <cd>01101101 11111100</cd>
            <p>
... to represent the following rational number.
            </p>
            <me>01101101_2 \times 2^{11111100_2-256}</me>
            <p>
Show how to verify that this float represents the decimal value <m>6.8125</m>.
(Remember that the value of <m>01101101_2</m> may be calculated automatically
by running <c>int('01101101',2)</c> in either Python or SageMath.)
            </p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <statement>
            <p>
Importantly, in the float implementation described by the previous exercise, a leading <c>1</c> in either byte
requires subtracting the value <m>256</m> from the usual binary value (in order to support negative values).
            </p>
            <p>
Use this rule to verify that this implementation might store the decimal <m>-0.265625</m> as <c>11101111 11111010</c>.
            </p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>
<!--        <exercise>
            <statement>
            <p>
This float implementation is non-unique since the number <m>2</m> may be represented by both
<c>00000010 00000000</c> and <c>00000001 00000001</c>.
