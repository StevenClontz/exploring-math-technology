The <term>counting numbers</term> (sometimes written as the lowercase Greek
letter omega <m>\omega</m>, also sometimes called
<q>whole numbers</q> or <q>natural numbers</q>) are those numbers used to
quantify whole items: <me>\{0,1,2,3,\dots,100,101,\dots,8675309,8675310,\dots\}</me>
            </p>

For each of the following possible rules for counting numbers, either decide that
it is true, or explain when the rule might fail.

            <p>
Adding one to a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>6</m> is a counting number, so <m>6+1=7</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Subtracting one from a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>6</m> is a counting number, so <m>6-1=5</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Doubling a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>32</m> is a counting number, so <m>32\times 2=64</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Halving a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>32</m> is a counting number, so <m>32\div 2=16</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Squaring a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>9</m> is a counting number, so <m>9^2=81</m> is also a counting number.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Square rooting a counting number results in another counting number. For example,
<m>9</m> is a counting number, so <m>\sqrt{9}=3</m> is also a counting number.

The <term>integers</term> <m>\mathbb Z</m> include all the counting numbers as well as their
negatives: <m>\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}</m>.

Explain which of the number rules from <xref ref="data-numbers-counting"/> work
when <q>counting number</q> is replaced with <q>integer</q>, and which ones fail.

        <statement>
            <p>
The <term>rational numbers</term> <m>\mathbb Q</m> include all fractions of integers
that don't divide by zero, such as <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>\frac{22}{7}</m>,
and <m>-\frac{1234812348}{42}</m>.

Explain which of the number rules from <xref ref="data-numbers-counting"/> work
when <q>counting number</q> is replaced with <q>rational number</q>, and which ones fail.

There are other kinds of <term>real numbers</term>, such as <m>e</m> and <m>\pi</m>, that aren't
rational. (The technical definition of the system of real numbers requires experience with
calculus, so we won't get into that here.) There are other kinds of numbers as well,
such as the <term>complex numbers</term> explorered in <xref ref="complex"/>.

Since SageMath tries to model mathematics as authentically as possible, it will try to recognize
when you are working with integers or rational numbers. For example, <c>type(-17/3)</c>
display that it is a <q><c>sage.rings.rational.Rational</c></q>
            </p>
            <p>
Use the <c>type()</c> tool help explain why <m>-\frac{1234812348}{42}</m> is an integer or
rational number.
