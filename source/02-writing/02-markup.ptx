Like many online platforms, Jupyter notebooks use <term>Markdown</term> syntax
for formatting text. The <url href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown Tutorial</url>
provides an excellent walkthrough on its basics.

Complete the <url href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown Tutorial</url> and
upload a screenshot of its <q>Congratulations</q> page below when you are done.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Markdown has many features for writing formatted documents using plain text, but
it does not provide much support for mathematical notation out-of-the-box.
            </p>
            <p>
Fortunately, many platforms that support Markdown also support <term>LaTeX</term>
(pronounced <q>lay-tek</q> or <q>lah-tek</q>,
and stylized as <m>\LaTeX{}</m>) markup for mathematical notation.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
To denote part of your writing as mathematical notation in a Markdown cell,
use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround your mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
Create two Markdown cells with the text <c>The solution to x+1=7 is x=6.</c>.
Then use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround the mathematical notation in one of those cells
to observe the difference. (Don't forget to use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to
display the formatted text.)
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Now create two Markdown cells with the text <c>The solutions to x^2-1=0 are x=-1 and x=1.</c>,
and use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround the mathematics in one cell.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
When typesetting longer mathematical notation, <c>\[</c> and <c>\]</c> may be used instead
to center the mathematics on a new line.
            </p>
            <p>
Copy <c>The only solution to x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1=0 is x=1.</c> into a Markdown cell and appropriately
format the long equation and short solution.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
One of the best ways to learn <m>\LaTeX{}</m> notation is to view the source written by other authors.
Consider the following formula:
            </p>
            <me>
ax^2+bx+c=0 \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
            </me>
            <p>
To view the source markup for the above formula while in a Jupyter notebook on CoCalc, you can
select the cell, and then use the <kbd>Edit</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Edit protect</kbd> menu option to make the cell
editable. If you accidentally delete something, you can use CoCalc's Time Travel feature
to restore it.
(To view the LaTeX source of any mathematical notation in the HTML verison of this book,
you can simply right-click the equation and use the menu that appears.)
            </p>
            <p>
Get the source for the formula above, and paste it into a Markdown cell below.
            </p>
        </task>

        <introduction>
            <p>
Some LaTeX notation is rather straight-forward, with literal notation such as
<c>+</c> and <c>-</c>, and intuitive notation such as <c>^</c> for superscripts
and <c>_</c> for subscripts: <c>a_0+a_1^2=-a_2^3</c> produces <m>a_0+a_1^2=-a_2^3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
But multiplication cannot be represented by, say, <c>x</c>, since that represents the variable
<m>x</m>. (Instead we write <c>2 \times 3</c> to produce <m>2 \times 3</m>.)
            </p>
            <p>
Note that <c>z_123</c> produces <m>z_123</m>, so grouping in LaTeX may be accomplished
with curly braces <c>{}</c>: <c>z_{123}</c> produces <m>z_{123}</m>. Actual curly braces
may be displayed as follows: <c>\{1,2,3\}</c> produces <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
Even professionals usually know just a small subset of all the LaTeX commands available.
Instead, references like
<url href="https://katex.org/docs/supported.html">KaTeX's Support Table</url>
and tools like
<url href="https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">DeTeXify</url>
allow for easy lookup of LaTeX commands as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
For each of the following samples of mathematical notation, <em>don't</em> peek at
their source markup. Instead, use the above resources to replicate the notation as
best as possible in a Markdown cell. After you've done as well as possible on your own,
you should then compare with the original source code to improve your original work.

LaTeX markup is used by many applications for typesetting mathematical notation.
But it's also possible to write entire documents in LaTeX, that can be distributed
as PDFs. Since it's very easy to write mathematics, manage bibliographies,
and integrate a LaTeX document with computer code, it's very common for STEM
researchers to author documents in LaTeX.
            </p>

CoCalc provides a convenient LaTeX editor that you can use from your web browser.
Try it out by following these steps.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
From the <kbd>+ New</kbd> menu option, create a new LaTeX document in the
same folder as this notebook.
A default document will appear on the left, and its PDF output appears on the right.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
The top part of the code is the <term>preamble</term> with various configurations,
most of which you don't need to worry about. There is a place to define the title
and author of the paper. Change the title of the paper to match your favorite TV show,
and change the author to be named after a character on that show.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
By default the produced PDF will include today's date. This can be configured by
inserting the command <c>\date{Month Day, Year}</c> in the preamble. Use this
to change the date to be one week from today instead.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
The <term>body</term> of the document is between the <c>\begin{document}</c>
and <c>\end{document}</c> commands. The <c>\maketitle</c> command tells LaTeX
to show the title, author, and date.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Add some text two lines below the <c>\maketitle</c> command, quoting a character
from your favorite show.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
Finally, copy-paste some mathematical notation from the previous activities
so it appears below the quote in your LaTeX-produced PDF.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
When you're done, put a link to your LaTeX source file in a Markdown cell below.
Since it's located in the same folder, if your file was named <c>example.tex</c>,
then it can be linked to by entering <c>[Link to LaTeX file](example.tex)</c>.
