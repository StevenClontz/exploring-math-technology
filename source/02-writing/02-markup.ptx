    <title>Using Markdown and LaTeX</title>

Like many online platforms, Jupyter notebooks use <term>Markdown</term> syntax
for formatting text. The <url href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown Tutorial</url>
provides an excellent walkthrough on its basics.

        <introduction>
            <p>
Markdown has many features for writing formatted documents using plain text, but
it does not provide much support for mathematical notation out-of-the-box.
            </p>
            <p>
Fortunately, many platforms that support Markdown also support <term>LaTeX</term>
(pronounced <q>lay-tek</q>, stylized as <m>\LaTeX{}</m>) markup for mathematical notation.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
            <p>
To denote part of your writing as mathematical notation in a Markdown cell,
use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround your mathematics.
            </p>
            <p>
Create two Markdown cells with the text <c>The solution to x+1=7 is x=6.</c>.
Then use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround the mathematical notation in one of those cells
to observe the difference. (Don't forget to use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to
display the formatted text.)
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
Now create two Markdown cells with the text <c>The solutions to x^2-1=0 are x=-1 and x=1.</c>,
and use <c>\(</c> and <c>\)</c> to surround the mathematics in one cell.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
When typesetting longer mathematical notation, <c>\[</c> and <c>\]</c> may be used instead
to center the mathematics on a new line.
            </p>
            <p>
Copy <c>The only solution to x^4-4x^3+6x^2-4x+1=0 is x=1.</c> into a Markdown cell and appropriately
format the long equation and short solution.
            </p>
        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
One of the best ways to learn <m>\LaTeX{}</m> notation is to view the source written by other authors.
Consider the following formula:
            </p>
            <me>
ax^2+bx+c=0 \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
            </me>
            <p>
To view the source markup for the above formula while in a Jupyter notebook on CoCalc, you can
select the cell, and then use the <kbd>Edit</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Edit protect</kbd> menu option to make the cell
editable.
(To view the LaTeX source of any mathematical notation in the HTML verison of this book,
you can simply right-click the equation and use the menu that appears.)
            </p>
            <p>
Get the source for the formula above, and paste it into a Markdown cell below.
            </p>

        <introduction>
            <p>
Some LaTeX notation is rather straight-forward, with literal notation such as
<c>+</c> and <c>-</c>, and intuitive notation such as <c>^</c> for superscripts
and <c>_</c> for subscripts: <c>a_0+a_1^2=-a_2^3</c> produces <m>a_0+a_1^2=-a_2^3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
But multiplication cannot be represented by, say, <c>x</c>, since that represents the variable
<m>x</m>. (Instead we write <c>2 \times 3</c> to produce <m>2 \times 3</m>.)
            </p>
            <p>
Even professionals usually know just a small subset of all the LaTeX commands available. Instead, references like
<url href="http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/MathJaxDocumentation/TeXSyntax.htm">Dr. Burn's TeX Command Reference</url>
and tools like
<url href="https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">DeTeXify</url>
allow for easy lookup of LaTeX commands as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
For each of the following samples of mathematical notation, <em>don't</em> peek at
their source markup. Instead, use the above resources to replicate the notation as
best as possible in a Markdown cell. After you've done as well as possible on your own,
then compare with the corresponding source markup.
