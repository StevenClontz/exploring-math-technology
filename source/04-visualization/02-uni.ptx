In 2015, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey on <q>Gaming and Gamers</q>,
and published their results at
<url href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/"/>.
Some of this data has been summarized by the textbook author in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-video-game"/>.

All the data in the figure given is correct. Nonetheless, what do you notice about
how these data have been visualized? What do you wonder? Write a few sentences summarizing
your thoughts in a Markdown cell.

Choosing the right graphical visualization for your data depends on the kind of data you wish
to display. <term>Univariate data</term> only considers a collection of numbers each representing
a certain quantity, for example,
the prices of pizzas sold from the dataset studied in <xref ref="visualization-tables"/>.
The prices of the first twenty pizzas sold (truncated down to full-dollar amounts) on Jan 1 are shown
in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/>.

To quickly visualize a small dataset by hand, a <term>dot plot</term> may be drawn. Values of
the dataset are represented on the horizontal axis, and each time the value appears in the dataset,
an additional dot is drawn above the value. A dot plot representing the prices in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/> are shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot"/>.
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="visualization-uni-dot-plot">
                <caption>Dot plot of prices from <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/></caption>
                <image source="images/visualization-uni-dot-plot.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
A dot plot allows the reader to quickly scan a dataset and learn information about it.
For example, what two prices were the most common out of the twenty pizzas sold? How do you know?

The major feature of dot plots is that they are easy to draw by hand. On a sheet of paper or using a simple graphics
program, draw a dot plot representing
the prices of the first twenty pizzas sold on November 3rd, shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-1103"/>.
            </p>

A dot plot representing the prices of all pizzas sold on April 1st is shown in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot-large"/>. Is this a graphic you'd like to draw by hand?
Is this a useful graphic to create by computer? Write a couple sentences summarizing your thoughts.
