In 2015, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey on <q>Gaming and Gamers</q>,
and published their results at
<url href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/"/>.
Some of this data has been summarized by the textbook author in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-video-game"/>.

All the data in the figure given is correct. Nonetheless, what do you notice about
how these data have been visualized? What do you wonder? Write a few sentences summarizing
your thoughts in a Markdown cell.

Choosing the right graphical visualization for your data depends on the kind of data you wish
to display. <term>Univariate data</term> only considers a collection of numbers each representing
a certain quantity, for example,
the prices of pizzas sold from the dataset studied in <xref ref="visualization-tables"/>.
The prices of the first twenty pizzas sold (truncated down to full-dollar amounts) on
January 1st are shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/>.

To quickly visualize a small dataset by hand, a <term>dot plot</term> may be drawn. Values of
the dataset are represented on the horizontal axis, and each time the value appears in the dataset,
an additional dot is drawn above the value. A dot plot representing the prices in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/> is shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot"/>.
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="visualization-uni-dot-plot">
                <caption>Dot plot of prices from <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/></caption>
                <image source="images/visualization-uni-dot-plot.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
A dot plot allows the reader to quickly scan a dataset and learn information about it.
For example, what two prices were the most common out of the twenty pizzas sold? How do you know?

            <p>
The major feature of dot plots is that they are easy to draw by hand. On a sheet of paper or using a simple graphics
program, draw a dot plot representing
the prices of the first twenty pizzas sold on November 3rd, shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-1103"/>.

A dot plot representing the prices (truncated down to the nearest dollar) of <em>all</em> pizzas
sold on April 1st is shown in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot-large"/>. Is this a graphic you'd like to draw by hand?
Is this a useful graphic to create by computer? Write a couple sentences summarizing your thoughts.

The <c>datascience</c> library supports quickly generating <term>histograms</term> visualizing
univariate data. Histograms are similar to dot plots, but measure how many values fall within
a range rather than individual values.

        <task>
            <p>
Repeat the steps from <xref ref="visualization-tables"/> to make <c>pizza_table</c> available
in this Jupyter notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
Confirm by running the code in <xref ref="visualization-uni-hist-0401"/>
to create a histogram of prices for April 1st.

        <task>
            <p>
Each <term>bin</term> or bar of the histogram counts how many prices fall within the range shown
along its base. For example, seven pizzas were sold at a price of around $19.
            </p>
            <p>
How many pizzas sold on April 1st had a price roughly between $12 and $13?

Compare the result of <xref ref="visualization-uni-hist-0401"/> to
<xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot-large"/>.
What do they have in common? How do they differ? What might explain these differences? Write a few
sentences summarizing your thoughts.
