In 2015, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey on <q>Gaming and Gamers</q>,
and published their results at
<url href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/"/>.
Some of this data has been summarized by the textbook author in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-video-game"/>.

All the data in the figure given is correct. Nonetheless, what do you notice about
how these data have been visualized? What do you wonder? Write a few sentences summarizing
your thoughts in a Markdown cell.

Choosing the right graphical visualization for your data depends on the kind of data you wish
to display. <term>Univariate data</term> only considers a collection of numbers each representing
a certain quantity, for example,
the prices of pizzas sold from the dataset studied in <xref ref="visualization-tables"/>.
The prices of the first twenty pizzas sold (truncated down to full-dollar amounts) on
January 1st are shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/>.

To quickly visualize a small dataset by hand, a <term>dot plot</term> may be drawn. Values of
the dataset are represented on the horizontal axis, and each time the value appears in the dataset,
an additional dot is drawn above the value. A dot plot representing the prices in
<xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/> is shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-dot-plot"/>.
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="visualization-uni-dot-plot">
                <caption>Dot plot of prices from <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-0101"/></caption>
                <image source="images/visualization-uni-dot-plot.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
A dot plot allows the reader to quickly scan a dataset and learn information about it.
For example, what two prices were the most common out of the twenty pizzas sold? How do you know?

        </task>
        <task>
            <p>
The major feature of dot plots is that they are easy to draw by hand. On a sheet of paper or using a simple graphics
program, draw a dot plot representing
the prices of the first twenty pizzas sold on November 3rd, shown in <xref ref="visualization-uni-prices-1103"/>.

The <c>datascience</c> library supports quickly generating <term>histograms</term> visualizing
univariate data. Histograms are similar to dot plots, but measure how many values fall within
a range rather than individual values.

        <task>
            <p>
Repeat the steps from <xref ref="visualization-tables"/> to make <c>pizza_table</c> available
in this Jupyter notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
Confirm by running the code in <xref ref="visualization-uni-hist-0401"/>
to create a histogram of prices for April 1st.

        <task>
            <p>
Each <term>bin</term> or bar of the histogram counts how many prices fall within the range shown
along its base (including the left endpoint but excluding the right endpoint).
For example, seven pizzas were sold at a price of around $19.
            </p>
            <p>
How many pizzas sold on April 1st had a price roughly between $12 andnd $13?

        <introduction>
            <p>
While a histogram is a useful summary of a univariate dataset, this data can often be
further summarized by the use of a <term>box plot</term>, also known as a
box-and-whisker plot.
            </p>
            <p>
A box plot organizes numerical data into four parts, each illustrating (roughly) a quarter
of all the data values: the left whisker, the left box half, the right box half,
and the right whisker. (We will explore these ranges in more detail in
<xref ref="measurements"/>.)
