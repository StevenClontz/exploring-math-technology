        <title>Why Study [the] Mathematics [of Data]?</title>
        <p>
It's a common complaint by mathematicians that students aren't interested in
mathematics for its own sake. And I (that is, me, the author, hello!)
understand this temptation. I got into math
because I like to solve puzzles, and who doesn't like puzzles?
        </p>
        <p>
But if you're like many of my students, it's not that they don't like puzzles.
It's that for them, math has never been about puzzles. Many students have found
that success in their math courses boils down to memorizing the formulas and tricks
their teacher tells them to. And yeah, that doesn't sound like much fun to me, either.
        </p>
        <p>
To address this, this textbook may not be like other textbooks you've used before.
Rather than focusing on a lot of formulas, definitions and worked examples, you'll be engaging with
several <term>activities</term> designed to get you (ideally with a group of your peers)
discovering as much of the mathematics for yourself. It's awesome how much more
mathematical results make sense when you know why they work, not because you're told,
but because you figured it out for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
This skill is not limited to your math class. In an increasingly cyber-foused world,
being able to replicate a skill because someone else told you how to do it
is only useful to the point where it cannot be more easily
automated by computers. So rather than focusing on <q>How is this done?</q>,
I encourage you to consider <q>Why does it work?</q> and <q>Why is it useful?</q> --
often, how it can be accomplished is involved in answering those questions anyway.
With that knowledge, either you'll be ready to do the work beyond the scope of automation,
or you'll be the one automating the work!

Now this book focuses specifically on the Mathematics of Data. Of course, <term>data</term>
are all around us. This book may be thought of as a sequence of written words,
but it was written on a computer, it can also be thought of as a seqeunce of <m>0</m>s and
<m>1</m>s on a hard disk. While computers do this kind of serialization of data from
one form to another every day, <term>data scientists</term> also have the job of taking
information about our world and converting it from one form to another. Their goal is
to make that information useful to other humans, so that they can make appropriate decisions
based on reality. But this is only effective if their techniques are based on solid
mathematical and statistical foundations, and incompetent (or simply evil) actors can
paint the wrong picture with their analysis by ignoring these foundations.

As this book was written for the Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering,
I will especially emphasize mathematical ideas and tools important for success in cyber
technoloyg, engineering, and security. Before earning my PhD in mathematics, I co-owned
and operated a cyber technology company offering a CRM <fn>Customer Relationship Management</fn>
web application for several years, making
us responsible for the PII <fn>Personally Indentifying Information</fn> of thousands of users.
Through that work and my continuing experience as a developer of open-source software,
I have found that the same core techniques of inquiry and problem-solving
I use in mathematics translate directly to understanding technology and security concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
While you don't need to be a professional
mathematician to work in cyber, the cutting-edge techniques of cyber are often
rooted in mathematics. For an excellent overview of the connections between
cyber security and mathematics, I encourage you to read

Thank you for reading this brief (?) introduction! And as I tell anyone about to dive
into some fun puzzles, happy solving!
