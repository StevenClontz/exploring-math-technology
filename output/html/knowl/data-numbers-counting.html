<div class="introduction">
<p>The <dfn class="terminology">counting numbers</dfn> (sometimes written as the lowercase Greek letter omega \(\omega\text{,}\) also sometimes called “whole numbers” or “natural numbers”) are those numbers used to quantify whole items:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\{0,1,2,3,\dots,100,101,\dots,8675309,8675310,\dots\}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For each of the following possible rules for counting numbers, either decide that it is true, or explain when the rule might fail.</p>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Adding one to a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(6\) is a counting number, so \(6+1=7\) is also a counting number.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h6>
<p>Subtracting one from a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(6\) is a counting number, so \(6-1=5\) is also a counting number.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>Doubling a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(32\) is a counting number, so \(32\times 2=64\) is also a counting number.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>Halving a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(32\) is a counting number, so \(32\div 2=16\) is also a counting number.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h6>
<p>Squaring a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(9\) is a counting number, so \(9^2=81\) is also a counting number.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h6>
<p>Square rooting a counting number results in another counting number. For example, \(9\) is a counting number, so \(\sqrt{9}=3\) is also a counting number.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="data-numbers.html#data-numbers-counting">in-context</a></span>
