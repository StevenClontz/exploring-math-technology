<p>This skill is not limited to your math class. In an increasingly cyber-foused world, being able to replicate a skill because someone else told you how to do it is only useful to the point where it cannot be more easily automated by computers. So rather than focusing on “How is this done?”, I encourage you to consider “Why does it work?” and “Why is it useful?” -- often, how it can be accomplished is involved in answering those questions anyway. With that knowledge, either you'll be ready to do the work beyond the scope of automation, or you'll be the one automating the work!</p>
