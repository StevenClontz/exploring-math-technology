<p>To address this, this textbook may not be like other textbooks you've used before. Rather than focusing on a lot of formulas, definitions and worked examples, you'll be engaging with several <dfn class="terminology">activities</dfn> designed to get you (ideally with a group of your peers) discovering as much of the mathematics for yourself. It's awesome how much more mathematical results make sense when you know why they work, not because you're told, but because you figured it out for yourself.</p>
