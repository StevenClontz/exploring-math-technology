<p>As this book was written for the Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering, I will especially emphasize mathematical ideas and tools important for success in cyber technoloyg, engineering, and security. Before earning my PhD in mathematics, I co-owned and operated a cyber technology company offering a CRM <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> web application for several years, making us responsible for the PII <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> of thousands of users. Through that work and my continuing experience as a developer of open-source software, I have found that the same core techniques of inquiry and problem-solving I use in mathematics translate directly to understanding technology and security concerns.</p>
