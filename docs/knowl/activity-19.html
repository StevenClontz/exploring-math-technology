<p>Something all these sets of numbers described above is that they are <dfn class="terminology">infinite</dfn>: if you had a finite list of them, take the biggest and add one, and you'll have something you forgot in your list.</p>
<p>While SageMath does its best to hide this limitation from users, having finitely-many possible numbers is not ideal for data intended for storage on a physical computer. To account for this, some lower-level languages offer data types like the <dfn class="terminology">short</dfn> that account for a useful (but finite) range of integers. In particular, shorts are integers that may be stored as a short finite list of the binary digits \(0\) and \(1\text{.}\) (Each binary digit is also known as a <dfn class="terminology">bit</dfn>.)</p>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Only two numbers may be described using one binary digit: \(0_2\) and \(1_2\text{.}\) Only four numbers may be described using two binary digits: \(00_2\text{,}\) \(01_2\text{,}\) \(10_2\text{,}\) and \(11_2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Describe all the possible numbers using three binary digits.</p>

<p>What do you notice about this pattern? According to this pattern, how many numbers do you expect can be described using four binary digits? Five digits?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h6>
<p>A <dfn class="terminology">byte</dfn> of computer storage is eight binary digits. How many different values of data can be stored in a byte?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h6>
<p>How many different numbers can be stored as a short data type that uses two bytes?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="data-numbers.html#activity-19">in-context</a></span>
