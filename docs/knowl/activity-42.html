<div class="introduction">
<p>In probability, an <dfn class="terminology">experiment</dfn> is an action with a measurable result. Taking this action is called a <dfn class="terminology">trial</dfn>, and each possible result of a trial are called an <dfn class="terminology">outcome</dfn>. The set of all possible outcomes for an experiment is known as the <dfn class="terminology">sample space</dfn> for that experiment.</p>
<p>Flipping a coin is an example of an experiment. Tossing the coin is a trial for that experiment, with the possible outcomes of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> (Heads) or <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (Tails). Therefore the sample space for flipping a coin is the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{H,T\right\}\text{.}\)</span> We say the coin is <dfn class="terminology">fair</dfn> because the results of Heads and Tails are equally likely to happen during a trial.</p>
<p>Consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die, with sides labeled by the positive counting numbers one through six. (For short, such dice are known as D6.)</p>
