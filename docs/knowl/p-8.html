<p>Now this book focuses specifically on using technology for mathematics and data science. Of course, <dfn class="terminology">data</dfn> are all around us. This book may be thought of as a sequence of written words, but it was written on a computer, it can also be thought of as a seqeunce of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>s and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>s on a hard disk. While computers do this kind of serialization of data from one form to another every day, <dfn class="terminology">data scientists</dfn> also have the job of taking information about our world and converting it from one form to another. Their goal is to make that information useful to other humans, so that they can make appropriate decisions based on reality. But this is only effective if their techniques are based on solid mathematical and statistical foundations, and incompetent (or simply evil) actors can paint the wrong picture with their analysis by ignoring these foundations.</p>
