<div class="introduction">
<p>One of the most useful counting tools in mathematics is the <dfn class="terminology">multiplication principle</dfn>. This principle is used when all the items to be counted come from a sequence of choices. If each item is made by making a choice from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> things, then a choice from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> things, then a choice from <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> things, and so on, then the total number of items is given by the product:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a\times b\times c\times \cdots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For example, suppose that a breakfast must include either eggs <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> sausage <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> or pancakes <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to eat, and either coffee <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> or juice <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> to drink. Then this six possible breakfasts are eggs/coffee, eggs/juice, sausage/coffee, sausage/juice, pancakes/coffee, and pancakes/juice. Symbolically, these choices are:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
Ec,Ej,Sc,Sj,Pc,Pj
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, this number six can be computed without listing out every choice. This is because there are <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> choices for food and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> choices for drink, yielding <span class="process-math">\(3\times 2=6\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>Suppose for a fancy dinner you are given four options as an appetizer, six options as an entree, three options as a beverage, and two options as a dessert. How many different dinners are possible?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>

<p>What if instead you consider the choice to skip any part of the meal, holding the appetizer, entree, beverage, and/or dessert. How many dinners are possible in that case?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
